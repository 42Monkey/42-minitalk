# Minitalk

Minitalk is a client-server communication program designed to demonstrate inter-process communication (IPC) using signals in C. This project is part of the 42 school curriculum, focusing on low-level system programming concepts such as signal handling, bit manipulation, and memory management.

## How It Works

The Minitalk project consists of two parts: a server and a client.

### Server

- The server starts by printing its PID (Process ID) and waits for signals.
- It receives signals from the client and reconstructs the binary data into characters, then prints the message.

### Client

- The client takes a message, converts each character into binary, and sends the binary data bit-by-bit to the server using two signals:
  - SIGUSR1: Represents a binary 0.
  - SIGUSR2: Represents a binary 1.

## Communication Process

- The server listens for SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals using the sigaction system call.
- The client sends each character of the message to the server as a sequence of signals.
- The server assembles the bits received from the signals into characters and prints the message.

## Code Explanation

### server.c

The server listens for SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals. Each signal corresponds to a bit (0 for SIGUSR1, 1 for SIGUSR2). The server shifts these bits into position to form characters and prints the result. Once a full character is reconstructed, it is displayed in the terminal.

Key steps in the server:

1. Signal handling: The server uses sigaction to set up handlers for SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
2. Reconstructing characters: For each signal received, the server shifts the bits left and accumulates them into a complete character.
3. Displaying the message: After receiving a full character, it is printed to the terminal.

### client.c

The client takes a string and converts each character to its binary representation. For each bit, it sends SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 to the server, depending on whether the bit is 0 or 1. The kill function is used to send the signals to the serverâ€™s PID.

Key steps in the client:

1. Binary conversion: The client converts each character into a sequence of bits.
2. Signal transmission: Each bit is sent as either SIGUSR1 (for 0) or SIGUSR2 (for 1).
3. Message delivery: The client sends the message bit-by-bit to the server, waiting briefly between each signal.
